## data-set-randomizer

This repo utilizes `dplyr` to randomize the data from a base data set. This allow someone to create multiple iterations of the original data set. Allowing for better understanding of statistical analysis utilizing a different data set each time. Each iteration will allow the user to focus on the statistical methods and not the use of the same data set over and over again, allowing for some creativity and critical thinking to take place.
